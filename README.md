🌟 Project Title: Nova - Voice Activated AI Assistant

Nova is a smart, voice-controlled virtual assistant developed using Python. It can perform real-world tasks like web browsing, music playback, and fetching news headlines — all triggered by your voice.

This project is a hands-on implementation of how voice interfaces can power daily utilities, much like Alexa or Google Assistant.

🚀 Features:

🎙️ Voice Recognition using the speech_recognition library

🗣️ Activated by the wake word "Hello"

🔊 Converts text to speech using both pyttsx3 (offline) and gTTS with pygame (online playback)

🌐 Opens websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn through simple voice commands

🎵 Plays music using links from a custom musicLibrary module

📰 Fetches and speaks out the latest headlines using NewsAPI

🤖 Future-ready for integration with OpenAI's GPT models to answer general queries

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python

Libraries used: speech_recognition, pyttsx3, gTTS, pygame, webbrowser, requests

Future scope: Integration with openai for smart assistant behavior

📦 How to Run the Project:

Clone the repository

Install all required Python libraries using pip install

Make sure your microphone and speaker are working properly

Run the main Python file: nova.py

Say "Hello" to activate Nova and then speak any of the supported commands

Supported Example Commands:

"Open Google"

"Open YouTube"

"Play [song name]"

"Read the news"

🌱 Future Enhancements:

Integration with OpenAI GPT for smarter question-answering

Weather report feature

Sending emails via voice commands

GUI interface using Tkinter or PyQt for better interactivity
